# SAASlanguage
# SyntaxBlend

We will be using Python3 for this project. The language that we will be creating will be our own implementation of SAAS.

In this module -- 1lexerSimple, we create the lexer, which breaks up our input into a list of what we call tokens. We can then use those tokens in the next module to further analyze the code.

To get the output of the first module -- 1lexerSimple 
Commands:

`cd 1lexerSimple`

`python3 shell.py`

In this second module -- 2parserSimple we create the parser, which takes in the tokens created by the lexer and builds up what we call an abstract syntax tree, which is basically a tree of the structure of the code. We can then traverse that tree in the next module and interpret it.

To get the output of the second module -- 1parserSimple 
Commands:

`cd 2parserSimple`

`python3 shell.py`

In this third module --3interpreterSimple we create the interpreter, which traverses the tree we built up in the last module and executes the appropriate code. By the end of this module our simple expression interpreter is complete, supporting ints, floats, simple operations and parentheses.

To get the output of the third module -- 3interpreterSimple 
Commands:

`cd 3interpreterSimple`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 4interpreterSimple2 we will be adding a power operator the the language, and this involves updating the lexer, the parser and the interpreter.

To get the output of the fourth module -- 4interpreterSimple2
Commands:

`cd 4interpreterSimple2`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module --5variables we add support for variables in our language. This requires updating the lexer, parser and interpreter, along with adding a new SymbolTable class.

To get the output of the fifth module -- 5variables
Commands:

`cd 5variables`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 6comparisonOperators we add all the different comparison operators to our language: equals, not equals, less than, greater than, etc.

To get the output of the sixth module -- 6comparisonOperators
Commands:

`cd 6comparisonOperators`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 7ifStatement we add in the IF statement. 

To get the output of the seventh module -- 7ifStatement
Commands:

`cd 7ifStatement`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 8forAndWhile we add in the FOR statement and WHILE statements.

To get the output of the eighth module -- 8forAndWhile
Commands:

`cd 8forAndWhile`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 9functions we add in the Functions to our programming language.

To get the output of the ninth module -- 9functions
Commands:

`cd 9functions`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 10strings we add in the Strings.

To get the output of the 10th module -- 10strings
Commands:

`cd 10strings`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 11lists we add another new type to our language - lists.

To get the output of the 11th module -- 11lists
Commands:

`cd 11lists`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 12builtInFuncs we add quite a few built-in functions to our language, including print, input, clear, type checking, and list operations. You may add plenty more, such as string operations, math functions, random number generators and more!

To get the output of the 12th module -- 12builtInFuncs
Commands:

`cd 12builtInFuncs`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 13multiLineStatements we add multi-line statements to our language (for if, for, while and functions).

To get the output of the 13th module -- 13multiLineStatements
Commands:

`cd 13multiLineStatements`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module -- 14returnContBreak we add the return, continue and break statements to functions and loops!

To get the output of the 14th module -- 14returnContBreak
Commands:

`cd 14returnContBreak`

`python3 shell.py`

In this module 15fileInput we add run statement to run an external file and comments.

To get the output of the 15th module -- 15fileInput
Commands:

`cd 15fileInput`

`python3 shell.py`
